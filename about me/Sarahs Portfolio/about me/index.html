       I'am an inspiring Web Developer. Im currntly doing freelance work to gain more experience. 
       I want to help people make engaging websites. I've started working on HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT back in College,
       and the passion have been growing ever since. Hoping to be a senior developer one day. 
       Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer over 2 years ago, I've done remote work for agencies, 
       consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business and consumer use.
